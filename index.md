### Welcome to the gLabels Label Designer project!

gLabels Label Designer is a GUI program for designing and printing labels and
business cards.  It is designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off
label and business card sheets that you’ll find at most office supply stores.

gLabels can be used to design address labels, name tags, price tags,
cd/dvd labels, or just about anything else that is organized in a regular
pattern on a sheet of paper.  Labels (or cards) can contain text, images, lines,
shapes, and barcodes.  gLabels also includes a simple document-merge
feature which lets you print a unique label for each record from an external
data source, such as a CSV file.
