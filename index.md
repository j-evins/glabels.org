gLabels Label Designer is a free GUI program for designing and printing labels and
business cards.  It is designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off
label and business card sheets that you’ll find at most office supply stores.

gLabels can be used to design address labels, name tags, price tags,
cd/dvd labels, or just about anything else that is organized in a regular
pattern on a sheet of paper.  Labels (or cards) can contain text, images, lines,
shapes, and barcodes.  gLabels also includes a simple document-merge
feature which lets you print a unique label for each record from an external
data source, such as a CSV file.

[^1]: The legacy 3.x version has not been supported since 2018.  However, many Linux distributions still distribute it, and it is showing its age by breaking as various library dependencies are updated.
